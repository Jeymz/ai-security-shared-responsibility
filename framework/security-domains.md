# Security Domains in AI Systems

## Overview

This document details the 16 security domains that comprise the AI Security Shared Responsibility Framework. These domains represent the comprehensive security considerations required for safe AI deployment.

Domains 1-12 are traditional security areas adapted for AI systems, while domains 13-16 (marked with ★) are emerging security challenges unique to modern AI deployments.
